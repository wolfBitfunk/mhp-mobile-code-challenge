# MHP - Mobile-App Coding Challenge

Android App as solution for the [Mobile-App Coding Challenge](https://github.com/MHP-A-Porsche-Company/coding-challenges/blob/master/Mobile/README.md)

## Solution

The solution was written using [Android Studio Dolphin | 2021.3.1 Patch 1](https://developer.android.com/studio/).

## Usage

The screenshot tests are screen density dependent. So calling `./gradlew connectedCheck` might fail if the device density is different to the one they have been taken. They have been created for my phone and a Pixel XL 5.5" emulator.

### Create new screenshot for desired device density:

Open `ComposeTestScreenshot.kt` in folder `app-android/src/androidTest/java/com/wolfmontwe/mhp/challenge/mobile/android/app/test/compose/` and change `saveAsExpected = true`

Then run `./gradlew connectedCheck` to generate the screenshots and `./copy_screenshot.sh` to copy them in the project androidTest assets folder.

Disable the flat and run again.
